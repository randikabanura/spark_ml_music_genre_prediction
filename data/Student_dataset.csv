clawfinger,i guess i ll never know,2006,metal,after all these precious years you chose to just give in why did you leave so many things undone i only scratched the surface of the thoughts you had within and for me your life had just begun why did you think that you were never good enough to give when you accepted me right from the start i never saw the side of you that didn't want to live and i miss you from the bottom of my heart what was it that you never told a soul about yourself what kind of thoughts were buried inside was there really no one there you thought would understand or was the only barrier your pride with so much love around you i just wish you'd loved yourself 'cause no one here can ever take your place you were someone special and my words just can't express how much i miss the warmth of your embrace why did you just give in why did you just give up and let it go i guess i'll never know it's hard to see you disappear without a real good bye there's so many things i wish i'd said but all the little things you did that made it all worthwhile meant more than all the tears you ever shed you always seemed so happy but i guess no one can tell what goes on inside a persons mind you loved your children dearly and you did your very best and someone new like you is hard to find chorus all the things you went through for your children every day and all the sacrifices that you made were worth much more than anything that wealth could ever buy and now that love can never be repaid in the end i guess you couldn't take it anymore so you closed your eyes and swallowed all your pain i know that you've done the same so many times before but all the questions in my mind remain

eidolon,lost voyage,2007,metal,theme sail amidst the open sky - the quest is now reality beauty and grace - we blaze the trail - the seas eternity floating away into a world of forever no land in sight - only sea and faded sky the days now pass - as reality becomes illusion lost voyage on the sea of dreams meditation - serenity - never knowing the fear that lies ahead now trapped within the waves of fury splintered our ship to pieces - fading screams are washed away who will see another day? no land in sight - only sea and faded sky the days now pass - as reality becomes illusion lost voyage on the sea of dreams solo endless waves crashing down - to wash away the lifeless souls all there's left to do is hope clinging to life - abandoned dreams - will no one hear my final screams! as i drift into the sea of red lost voyage on the sea of dreams theme
eidolon,scarred,2007,metal,"balled up - enter the pain fists of fury - the deafening blows ridiculed by drunken rage unleashing the beast within repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery huddled in darkness - a wide-eyed nightmare together - maintain a sense of sanity to speak the truth - intensified hatred the mind takes you to a better place repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery my god - what is this pain? why must i feel so alone? what makes him release all this pain? a family torn to shreds secretly unified - in hatred and vengeance - for years of torment and misery now i live for the day - for us to see eye to eye you stand before me and then you die - for mental scars never heal! solo horrified coward - forgotten my face? intensifying - my chance to repay praying to god you now scream my name vengeance is mine, the last breath you take repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery"
